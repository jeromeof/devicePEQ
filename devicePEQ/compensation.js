// Shared Q compensation.
//
// Several devices realise a Q that differs from the one they were told to use.
// The correction is always the same shape — send Q/ratio, report back Q*ratio —
// but the ratio itself follows different LAWS on different hardware, so the law
// is named in modelConfig rather than hardcoded per handler:
//
//   qCompensation: { model: 'rbjGain' }                  // ratio = 1/A(gain)
//   qCompensation: { model: 'constant', ratio: 0.701 }   // flat scale
//   qCompensation: { model: 'cosNyquist', designFs: 49152 }  // ratio = cos(pi*f/designFs)
//   (absent)                                             // no compensation
//
// 'cosNyquist' has no fitted constants — it is  ratio = cos(pi*f/fs)  and drops
// out of one arithmetic slip. RBJ's peaking alpha is sin(w0)/(2Q); a device that
// computes sin(w0/2)/Q instead — the same value if you forget that sin(w0) is
// 2*sin(w0/2)*cos(w0/2) — realises
//
//   Q_realised / Q_requested = sin(w0) / (2*sin(w0/2)) = cos(w0/2)
//
// which is 1.0 at DC, still 0.998 at 1 kHz, and falls away only as the filter
// approaches Nyquist: 0.87 at 8 kHz, 0.72 at 12 kHz, 0.52 at 16 kHz. That is the
// shape measured on WalkPlay SchemeNo11 parts, and fitting a free constant and
// exponent to those measurements judged no better than the plain law.
//
// `designFs` is the rate the device's OWN FIRMWARE designs its biquads at — a
// fixed property of the part, not the rate being streamed and not the rate any
// test happened to run at. w0 above is the device's internal digital frequency,
// 2*pi*(frequency written)/designFs, so the law needs only the number actually
// sent on the wire and this one device constant. Nothing here tracks the stream.
//
// On SchemeNo11 designFs is ~49152 (a 49.152 MHz clock domain) while the part
// runs at 48000, and that same mismatch is what produces the flat centre-
// frequency offset these devices also need: 48000/49152 = 0.9766, measured
// 0.9775. One device trait, two visible symptoms, neither tied to the test.
//
// The ratio is always expressed as REALISED / REQUESTED, i.e. what a
// measurement reports, never its reciprocal. A device whose filters come out
// 29.9% too wide is configured as 0.701, which is exactly the number the REW
// verification tool prints — so nobody has to remember which way to invert it.
//
// Note what this module deliberately does NOT cover: FiiO's shelf correction is
// a slope<->Q transform, not a ratio, and lives in fiioUsbHidHandler.js. Only
// laws that reduce to "multiply the Q by something" belong here.
//

// RBJ peaking amplitude. A + 1/A is invariant under A -> 1/A and the peaking
// law uses |gain|, so cuts and boosts of equal size behave identically — which
// is what the FiiO measurements showed.

// A shelf's corner frequency has more than one defensible definition — the
// midpoint (where the response is half the shelf gain) and the edge differ by
// sqrt(A), and the two conventions pull in opposite directions for low and high
// shelves. A device using the other convention lands its shelf at
//
//     realised = requested x A^(+1/2)   for LSQ
//     realised = requested x A^(-1/2)   for HSQ
//

// which is why small shelves pass and large ones fail.

// corner moves by less than sqrt(A) once bilinear-transformed. Prewarping is
// therefore part of the model, not a refinement: on a DS3 at 48 kHz it is the
// difference between a 10 kHz shelf landing at x0.708 (predicted without) and
// x0.760 (predicted with, measured x0.769).
//
// `fs` is the rate the device's DSP runs at. It only matters above a few kHz —
